# Twilio-Chat
Chat App utilizing Twilio api
This chat app utizes twilios programmable chat application. For the front-end I'm using React and the backend I'm using NODE.js and EXPRESS. In order to access TWILIOS caht api you need to generate a token using your credentials. In order to do that I needed to built a client side server to handle the request and relay the information to the application.
