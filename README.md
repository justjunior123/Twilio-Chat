# Twilio-Chat

This is a simple chat application utilizing Twilios Programmable chat API. The architecture of this bare bones app utilizes the same layout of a previous chat application that I wrote - Chatter-Box. The key differences of this app are beyond the UI/UX presentational components. To start off Twilio api requires developers to create a unique token to access the chat client properties. This token has to be generated by an external client server that has to run in tandem with the client application. Once the unique token is generated and accessed through the client application then a whole world of possibilities opens up for developers.

# Technologies Utilized

All of the technologies utilized for the creation of this chat skeleton are the following: 
REACT - FRONTEND;
EXPRESS - CLIENT SERVER;
NODE.JS;
JAVASCRIPT(ES6);
JQUERY;


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
